### Introduction

On Google Calendar (Web), when you have multiple calendars enabled, and some events are colored differently from their default, a colored border appears on the left side of those events. This border matches the color of the calendar the event belongs to.

But let's face it, those borders arenâ€™t pretty. That's why I created this Chrome extension to automatically remove them for a cleaner look.

### Installation Instructions

1. **Download the Repository:**

   - Click on the `<> Code` button at the top of this page and select "Download ZIP".
   - Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a convenient location on your computer.

2. **Open Chrome Extensions Page:**

   - Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.

3. **Enable Developer Mode:**

   - Toggle the switch for Developer mode in the top right corner.

4. **Load the Extension:**

   - Click on the "Load unpacked" button.
   - Select the directory where you extracted the ZIP file.

5. **Verify Installation:**
   - Once the extension is loaded, go to Google Calendar and check if the borders are removed from the events.

That's it! Your Google Calendar should now have a cleaner look without the colored borders on the left side of events.

### How does it work ?

The HTML code of the borders looks like this :

```html
<div
  aria-hidden="true"
  class="jSrjCf"
  style="background-color: rgb(11, 128, 67);"
></div>
```

This extension finds them and remove them automatically.
